    "description": "We are a group of experienced educators from Hong Kong and moms who just immigrated to Vancouver, Canada. We aim to use our expertise to help parents and children systematically develop other skills using their mother tongue abilities at home. In familiar contexts, parents and children can communicate more effectively, and grow together. Therefore, we established \"Familogue\" in 2022, a registered non-profit organization in British Columbia."
